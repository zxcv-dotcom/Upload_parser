</head>

  <body> The AI bot is in the little dialog box on the bottom right of the page. Click on it to ask it questions about the two documents I have currently loaded:
    1. My analysis of the properly adjusted monetary values in Anarchy by William Dalrymple.
    2. National Bureau of Economic Research paper on the effect of management science on US productivity in WW2.
